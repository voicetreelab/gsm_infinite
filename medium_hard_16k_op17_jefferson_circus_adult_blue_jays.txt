The number of adult elephant in Luminara River equals the difference between the average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Bundle Ranch and the total number of newborn animal children in Jefferson Circus. The average number of newborn children per adult tasmanian devil in Moonshadow Current equals the average number of newborn children per adult crow in Jefferson Circus. The average number of newborn children per adult sperm whale in Crystalbrook Stream equals the difference between the number of adult crow in Hamilton Farm and the number of adult parrot in Hamilton Farm.

SOLUTION:
The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Bundle Ranch as G; so G = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Hamilton Farm as A; R = G = 4; so A = 4 * R = (4) * (4) = 16. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Jefferson Circus as N; P = A = 16; so N = 4 * P = (4) * (16) = 64. Define adult parrot in Jefferson Circus as t; so t = G = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Jefferson Circus as O; so O = N = 64. Define adult crow in Jefferson Circus as z; so z = 2. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Jefferson Circus as w; e = N = 64; so w = 2 + e = 2 + 64 = 66. Define adult blue jay in Jefferson Circus as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Jefferson Circus as T; Y = z * w = (2) * (66) = 132; B = x * N = (x) * (64) = 64*x; D = t * O = (4) * (64) = 256; E = Y + B = 132 + 64*x = 64*x + 132; T = E + D = 64*x + 132 + 256 = 64*x + 388. We know T = 644, so we have 64*x + 388 = 644 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 64*x + 388 = 644. Move all terms to one side: 64*x - 256 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 64*x = 256. Divide both sides by 64: x = 256 / 64. Solution: x = 4. Answer: 4.
