SOLUTION:
The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult owl in Pine Ridge as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Oakridge Riverside as m; E = x = x; so m = 1 + E = 1 + x = x + 1. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Beverly Forest as G; so G = m = x + 1. Define adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as L; so L = G - x = (x + 1) - (x) = 1. Define adult blue jay in Beverly Forest as Y; so Y = L = 1. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Oakridge Riverside as N; n = Y = 1; so N = 4 * n = (4) * (1) = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as c; so c = N = 4. Define adult blue jay in Oakridge Riverside as K; t = c + x = 4 + x = x + 4; so K = t + G = x + 4 + x + 1 = 2*x + 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Pine Ridge as B; so B = K - G = (2*x + 5) - (x + 1) = x + 4. We know B = 7, so we have x + 4 = 7 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: x + 4 = 7. Move all terms to one side: x - 3 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 1*x = 3. Divide both sides by 1: x = 3 / 1. Solution: x = 3. Answer: 3.
