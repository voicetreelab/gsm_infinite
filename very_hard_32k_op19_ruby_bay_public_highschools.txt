SOLUTION:
The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define public highschool in Ruby Bay as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define public highschool in Riverton City as g; Q = x = x; so g = 1 + Q = 1 + x = x + 1. Define regional medical school in Clearwater Bay as Y; so Y = g = x + 1. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Clearwater Bay as P; y = Y = x + 1; so P = 3 + y = 3 + x + 1 = x + 4. Define elementary school in Clearwater Bay as C; so C = P = x + 4. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Clearwater Bay as q; W = C = x + 4; so q = 4 * W = (4) * (x + 4) = 4*x + 16. Define elementary school in Riverton City as A; F = q = 4*x + 16; so A = 3 * F = (3) * (4*x + 16) = 12*x + 48. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Ruby Bay as p; m = A = 12*x + 48; so p = 4 + m = 4 + 12*x + 48 = 12*x + 52. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Ruby Bay as l; so l = p = 12*x + 52. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Clearwater Bay as k; G = l = 12*x + 52; so k = 2 * G = (2) * (12*x + 52) = 24*x + 104. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Riverton City as u; so u = k = 24*x + 104. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Riverton City as s; so s = u - P = (24*x + 104) - (x + 4) = 23*x + 100. We know s = 169, so we have 23*x + 100 = 169 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 23*x + 100 = 169. Move all terms to one side: 23*x - 69 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 23*x = 69. Divide both sides by 23: x = 69 / 23. Solution: x = 3. Answer: 3.
