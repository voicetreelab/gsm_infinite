", "question": "How many adult owl does Oakridge Riverside have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult parrot in Cedar Valley as y; so y = 2. Define adult owl in Cedar Valley as M; e = y = 2; so M = 4 * e = (4) * (2) = 8. Define total number of adult animals in Cedar Valley as a; so a = y + M = 2 + 8 = 10. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Cedar Valley as Y; so Y = a + y = 10 + 2 = 12. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Pine Ridge as g; so g = Y = 12. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Oakridge Riverside as r; so r = g - a = (12) - (10) = 2. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Oakridge Riverside as u; so u = g = 12. Define adult blue jay in Oakridge Riverside as n; so n = g = 12. Define adult owl in Oakridge Riverside as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Oakridge Riverside as N; Q = x * u = (x) * (12) = 12*x; l = n * r = (12) * (2) = 24; N = Q + l = 12*x + 24 = 12*x + 24. We know N = 60, so we have 12*x + 24 = 60 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 12*x + 24 = 60. Move all terms to one side: 12*x - 36 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 12*x = 36. Divide both sides by 12: x = 36 / 12. Solution: x = 3.

", "question": "How many adult owl does Pine Ridge have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Cedar Valley as z; so z = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Maple Creek as B; v = z = 4; so B = 4 + v = 4 + 4 = 8. Define adult parrot in Pine Ridge as e; w = B = 8; so e = 3 + w = 3 + 8 = 11. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Pine Ridge as y; so y = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Pine Ridge as I; U = y = 3; so I = 3 + U = 3 + 3 = 6. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as a; so a = I = 6. Define adult owl in Pine Ridge as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as Y; so Y = B = 8. Define total number of newborn animal children in Pine Ridge as j; b = e * I = (11) * (6) = 66; F = x * y = (x) * (3) = 3*x; c = Y * a = (8) * (6) = 48; A = b + F = 66 + 3*x = 3*x + 66; j = A + c = 3*x + 66 + 48 = 3*x + 114. We know j = 117, so we have 3*x + 114 = 117 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 3*x + 114 = 117. Move all terms to one side: 3*x - 3 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 3*x = 3. Divide both sides by 3: x = 3 / 3. Solution: x = 1. Answer: 1.", "op": 17, "id": 12, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult owl in Beverly Forest?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Maple Creek as c; so c = 3. Define adult parrot in Pine Ridge as y; so y = c = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Beverly Forest as F; so F = y = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Beverly Forest as n; b = F = 3; so n = 1 + b = 1 + 3 = 4. Define adult parrot in Beverly Forest as N; q = n = 4; so N = 3 * q = (3) * (4) = 12. Define adult blue jay in Beverly Forest as J; so J = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Beverly Forest as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult owl in Beverly Forest as k; v = J = 4; so k = 4 * v = (4) * (4) = 16. Define total number of newborn animal children in Beverly Forest as f; o = k * x = (16) * (x) = 16*x; w = J * n = (4) * (4) = 16; h = N * F = (12) * (3) = 36; l = o + w = 16*x + 16 = 16*x + 16; f = l + h = 16*x + 16 + 36 = 16*x + 52. We know f = 116, so we have 16*x + 52 = 116 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 16*x + 52 = 116. Move all terms to one side: 16*x - 64 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 16*x = 64. Divide both sides by 16: x = 64 / 16. Solution: x = 4.

", "question": "How many public highschool does Hawkesbury have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Glenfield City as g; so g = 1. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Westhaven City as y; so y = g = 1. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Glenfield City as C; G = y = 1; so C = 4 * G = (4) * (1) = 4. Define private middle school in Hawkesbury as Z; so Z = 4. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Hawkesbury as E; so E = 3. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Hawkesbury as Y; so Y = C - g = (4) - (1) = 3. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Hawkesbury as J; so J = 3. Define public highschool in Hawkesbury as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define regional medical school in Hawkesbury as z; so z = E = 3. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Hawkesbury as H; R = z * Y = (3) * (3) = 9; f = Z * E = (4) * (3) = 12; b = x * J = (x) * (3) = 3*x; M = R + f = 9 + 12 = 21; H = M + b = 21 + 3*x = 3*x + 21. We know H = 24, so we have 3*x + 21 = 24 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 3*x + 21 = 24. Move all terms to one side: 3*x - 3 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 3*x = 3. Divide both sides by 3: x = 3 / 3. Solution: x = 1.

", "question": "How many culinarian school does Shoreline City have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Clearwater Bay as B; so B = 4. Define elementary school in Clearwater Bay as z; so z = B = 4. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Clearwater Bay as Z; so Z = 2. Define private middle school in Clearwater Bay as F; so F = Z = 2. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Clearwater Bay as J; U = F * B = (2) * (4) = 8; a = z * Z = (4) * (2) = 8; J = U + a = 8 + 8 = 16. Define average number of teachers per culinarian school in Shoreline City as j; so j = J + z = 16 + 4 = 20. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Shoreline City as d; so d = 4. Define elementary school in Shoreline City as e; so e = 3. Define culinarian school in Shoreline City as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Shoreline City as L; M = x * j = (x) * (20) = 20*x; R = e * d = (3) * (4) = 12; L = M + R = 20*x + 12 = 20*x + 12. We know L = 52, so we have 20*x + 12 = 52 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 20*x + 12 = 52. Move all terms to one side: 20*x - 40 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 20*x = 40. Divide both sides by 20: x = 40 / 20. Solution: x = 2.

", "question": "How many intense detective thriller does Festival de Saint-Rivage have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of nominations per upbeat metropolis comedy in Festival de Saint-Rivage as q; so q = 1.

Define futuristic sci-fi movie in Festival de Saint-Rivage as U; so U = i + R = 0 + 1 = 1. Define intense detective thriller in Festival de Saint-Rivage as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later.

We know S = 6, so we have x + 4 = 6 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: x + 4 = 6. Move all terms to one side: x - 2 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 1*x = 2. Divide both sides by 1: x = 2 / 1. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 17, "id": 7, "template": "movie_festival_awards", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}
