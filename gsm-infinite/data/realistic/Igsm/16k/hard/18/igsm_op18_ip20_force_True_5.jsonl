Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Maple Creek as D; H = R = 1; so D = 3 * H = (3) * (1) = 3. Define adult eagle in Maple Creek as q; so q = D - R = (3) - (1) = 2. Define adult crow in Maple Creek as B; Y = q = 2; so B = 3 * Y = (3) * (2) = 6. Define total number of adult animals in Maple Creek as z; so z = B + q = 6 + 2 = 8. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Beverly Forest as G; K = z = 8; so G = 4 * K = (4) * (8) = 32. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Beverly Forest as P; so P = 4. Define adult owl in Beverly Forest as O; so O = z = 8. Define adult crow in Beverly Forest as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Beverly Forest as o; C = O * P = (8) * (4) = 32; d = x * G = (x) * (32) = 32*x; o = C + d = 32 + 32*x = 32*x + 32. We know o = 128, so we have 32*x + 32 = 128 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 32*x + 32 = 128. Move all terms to one side: 32*x - 96 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 32*x = 96. Divide both sides by 32: x = 96 / 32. Solution: x = 3.

", "question": "How many adult fox does Jefferson Circus have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in South Zoo as v; so v = 1. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in South Zoo as W; H = v = 1; so W = 3 + H = 3 + 1 = 4. Define adult bear in South Zoo as t; so t = 3. Define adult wolf in South Zoo as G; so G = 4. Define total number of newborn animal children in South Zoo as u; p = G * v = (4) * (1) = 4; o = t * W = (3) * (4) = 12; u = p + o = 4 + 12 = 16. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Jefferson Circus as a; Z = u = 16; so a = 2 * Z = (2) * (16) = 32. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in Jefferson Circus as R; so R = a = 32. Define adult bear in Jefferson Circus as E; so E = 3. Define adult fox in Jefferson Circus as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Jefferson Circus as r; T = E * R = (3) * (32) = 96; i = x * a = (x) * (32) = 32*x; r = T + i = 96 + 32*x = 32*x + 96. We know r = 128, so we have 32*x + 96 = 128 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 32*x + 96 = 128. Move all terms to one side: 32*x - 32 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 32*x = 32. Divide both sides by 32: x = 32 / 32. Solution: x = 1.

", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult deer in Maple Creek?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in Oakridge Riverside as q; so q = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Oakridge Riverside as k; B = q = 4; so k = 3 + B = 3 + 4 = 7. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Oakridge Riverside as a; P = k = 7; so a = 3 * P = (3) * (7) = 21. Define adult deer in Beverly Forest as D; w = a = 21; so D = 3 + w = 3 + 21 = 24. Define adult wolf in Beverly Forest as h; so h = 1. Define adult fox in Beverly Forest as W; so W = k + a = 7 + 21 = 28. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Maple Creek as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult bear in Beverly Forest as E; C = x + k = x + 7 = x + 7; so E = 3 * C = (3) * (x + 7) = 3*x + 21. Define total number of adult animals in Beverly Forest as b; N = W + E = 28 + 3*x + 21 = 3*x + 49; M = N + h = 3*x + 49 + 1 = 3*x + 50; so b = M + D = 3*x + 50 + 24 = 3*x + 74. We know b = 80, so we have 3*x + 74 = 80 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 3*x + 74 = 80. Move all terms to one side: 3*x - 6 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 3*x = 6. Divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 18, "id": 21, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many adult wolf does Mayer Aquarium have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Jefferson Circus as P; so P = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Jefferson Circus as r; i = P = 4; so r = 3 + i = 3 + 4 = 7. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Bundle Ranch as D; so D = r = 7. Define adult fox in Hamilton Farm as s; g = D = 7; so s = 1 + g = 1 + 7 = 8. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Hamilton Farm as b; so b = s + r = 8 + 7 = 15. Define adult wolf in Mayer Aquarium as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Hamilton Farm as o; B = b = 15; so o = 3 * B = (3) * (15) = 45. Define adult fox in Mayer Aquarium as h; so h = o = 45. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Mayer Aquarium as t; so t = b = 15. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Mayer Aquarium as A; so A = b = 15. Define total number of newborn animal children in Mayer Aquarium as O; d = x * A = (x) * (15) = 15*x; Q = h * t = (45) * (15) = 675; O = d + Q = 15*x + 675 = 15*x + 675. We know O = 735, so we have 15*x + 675 = 735 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 15*x + 675 = 735. Move all terms to one side: 15*x - 60 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 15*x = 60. Divide both sides by 15: x = 60 / 15. Solution: x = 4.

", "question": "How many adult parrot does South Zoo have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult eagle in South Zoo as v; so v = 1. Define adult eagle in Bundle Ranch as N; w = v = 1; so N = 3 * w = (3) * (1) = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in South Zoo as Q; so Q = N = 3. Define adult blue jay in South Zoo as I; M = Q = 3; so I = 2 * M = (2) * (3) = 6. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in South Zoo as R; so R = I = 6. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium as o; s = R = 6; so o = 2 + s = 2 + 6 = 8. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium as l; so l = 3. Define adult parrot in South Zoo as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium as Y; so Y = x - v = (x) - (1) = x - 1. Define adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium as C; so C = l = 3. Define total number of newborn animal children in Mayer Aquarium as t; i = Y * o = (x - 1) * (8) = 8*x - 8; u = C * l = (3) * (3) = 9; t = i + u = 8*x - 8 + 9 = 8*x + 1. We know t = 25, so we have 8*x + 1 = 25 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 8*x + 1 = 25. Move all terms to one side: 8*x - 24 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 8*x = 24. Divide both sides by 8: x = 24 / 8. Solution: x = 3.

", "question": "How many adult fox does Pine Ridge have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult fox in Maple Creek as o; so o = 4. Define adult deer in Maple Creek as N; so N = o = 4. Define adult racoon in Maple Creek as O; so O = o = 4. Define total number of adult animals in Maple Creek as J; f = O + N = 4 + 4 = 8; so J = f + o = 8 + 4 = 12. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Cedar Valley as U; u = J + N = 12 + 4 = 16; so U = 3 * u = (3) * (16) = 48. Define adult fox in Pine Ridge as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult racoon in Pine Ridge as w; E = U = 48; so w = 2 * E = (2) * (48) = 96. Define adult deer in Pine Ridge as i; H = J + O = 12 + 4 = 16; so i = H + w = 16 + 96 = 112. Define total number of adult animals in Pine Ridge as a; M = w + i = 96 + 112 = 208; so a = M + x = 208 + x = x + 208. We know a = 211, so we have x + 208 = 211 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: x + 208 = 211. Move all terms to one side: x - 3 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 1*x = 3. Divide both sides by 1: x = 3 / 1. Solution: x = 3. Answer: 3.", "op": 18, "id": 11, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many adult eagle does Beverly Forest have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Cedar Valley as N; so N = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Cedar Valley as U; V = N = 4; so U = 1 + V = 1 + 4 = 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Cedar Valley as y; so y = U = 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Beverly Forest as C; so C = y - U = (5) - (5) = 0. Define adult crow in Beverly Forest as h; m = y = 5; so h = 3 * m = (3) * (5) = 15. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Beverly Forest as Y; so Y = 2. Define adult eagle in Beverly Forest as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult parrot in Beverly Forest as s; so s = y = 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Beverly Forest as K; so K = Y = 2. Define total number of newborn animal children in Beverly Forest as J; o = x * K = (x) * (2) = 2*x; t = h * C = (15) * (0) = 0; H = s * Y = (5) * (2) = 10; I = o + t = 2*x + 0 = 2*x; J = I + H = 2*x + 10 = 2*x + 10. We know J = 14, so we have 2*x + 10 = 14 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 2*x + 10 = 14. Move all terms to one side: 2*x - 4 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 2*x = 4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 18, "id": 14, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult racoon in Pine Ridge?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult racoon in Oakridge Riverside as M; so M = 4. Define adult wolf in Pine Ridge as F; so F = M = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in Pine Ridge as b; so b = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in Cedar Valley as m; G = F = 4; so m = 1 + G = 1 + 4 = 5. Define adult racoon in Pine Ridge as E; so E = m = 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Pine Ridge as c; so c = E = 5. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Cedar Valley as R; t = F = 4; so R = 2 + t = 2 + 4 = 6. Define adult bear in Pine Ridge as o; y = R = 6; so o = 3 + y = 3 + 6 = 9. Define average number of newborn children per adult racoon in Pine Ridge as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Pine Ridge as h; u = F * c = (4) * (5) = 20; w = E * x = (5) * (x) = 5*x; Q = o * b = (9) * (3) = 27; k = u + w = 20 + 5*x = 5*x + 20; h = k + Q = 5*x + 20 + 27 = 5*x + 47. We know h = 67, so we have 5*x + 47 = 67 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 5*x + 47 = 67. Move all terms to one side: 5*x - 20 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 5*x = 20. Divide both sides by 5: x = 20 / 5. Solution: x = 4.

", "question": "How many culinarian school does Brightford have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define culinarian school in Westhaven City as v; so v = 3. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Brightford as q; A = v = 3; so q = 2 + A = 2 + 3 = 5. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Brightford as G; V = q + v = 5 + 3 = 8; so G = 3 + V = 3 + 8 = 11. Define average number of teachers per elementary school in Westhaven City as R; so R = G = 11. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Evervale City as k; so k = R + v = 11 + 3 = 14. Define elementary school in Brightford as N; so N = k - v = (14) - (3) = 11. Define public highschool in Brightford as U; so U = 1. Define private middle school in Brightford as h; so h = 3. Define culinarian school in Brightford as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of schools in Brightford as O; E = x + h = x + 3 = x + 3; I = E + N = x + 3 + 11 = x + 14; so O = I + U = x + 14 + 1 = x + 15. We know O = 19, so we have x + 15 = 19 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: x + 15 = 19. Move all terms to one side: x - 4 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 1*x = 4. Divide both sides by 1: x = 4 / 1. Solution: x = 4. Answer: 4.", "op": 18, "id": 19, "template": "teachers_in_school", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many private middle school does Evervale City have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define regional medical school in Westhaven City as U; so U = 2. Define elementary school in Westhaven City as H; so H = 3. Define total number of schools in Westhaven City as G; so G = H + U = 3 + 2 = 5. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Brightford as I; so I = G + H = 5 + 3 = 8. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Evervale City as B; so B = I = 8. Define regional medical school in Evervale City as e; so e = I = 8. Define average number of teachers per public highschool in Evervale City as k; so k = 2. Define private middle school in Evervale City as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Evervale City as V; so V = e = 8. Define public highschool in Evervale City as A; so A = H = 3. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Evervale City as a; M = e * B = (8) * (8) = 64; w = A * k = (3) * (2) = 6; i = x * V = (x) * (8) = 8*x; Z = M + w = 64 + 6 = 70; a = Z + i = 70 + 8*x = 8*x + 70. We know a = 102, so we have 8*x + 70 = 102 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 8*x + 70 = 102. Move all terms to one side: 8*x - 32 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 8*x = 32. Divide both sides by 8: x = 32 / 8. Solution: x = 4.

We know m = 508, so we have 36*x + 364 = 508 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 36*x + 364 = 508. Move all terms to one side: 36*x - 144 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 36*x = 144. Divide both sides by 36: x = 144 / 36. Solution: x = 4.
