", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult fox in Mayer Aquarium?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult deer in Hamilton Farm as S; so S = 1. Define adult deer in South Zoo as d; g = S = 1; so d = 4 * g = (4) * (1) = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Hamilton Farm as E; e = d + S = 4 + 1 = 5; so E = 2 + e = 2 + 5 = 7. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Jefferson Circus as M; so M = E = 7. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Mayer Aquarium as C; P = M + S = 7 + 1 = 8; so C = 3 * P = (3) * (8) = 24. Define adult wolf in Mayer Aquarium as y; so y = C - S = (24) - (1) = 23. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Mayer Aquarium as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult fox in Mayer Aquarium as k; so k = M = 7. Define total number of newborn animal children in Mayer Aquarium as f; j = y * C = (23) * (24) = 552; c = k * x = (7) * (x) = 7*x; f = j + c = 552 + 7*x = 7*x + 552. We know f = 573, so we have 7*x + 552 = 573 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 7*x + 552 = 573. Move all terms to one side: 7*x - 21 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 7*x = 21. Divide both sides by 7: x = 21 / 7. Solution: x = 3.

", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult racoon in Maple Creek?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define adult deer in Cedar Valley as u; so u = 1. Define adult fox in Cedar Valley as y; c = u = 1; so y = 2 + c = 2 + 1 = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Maple Creek as w; R = y = 3; so w = 4 * R = (4) * (3) = 12. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Cedar Valley as h; so h = w = 12. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Maple Creek as n; so n = h + y = 12 + 3 = 15. Define adult deer in Maple Creek as f; so f = 2. Define adult fox in Maple Creek as i; so i = 2. Define adult racoon in Maple Creek as s; so s = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult racoon in Maple Creek as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Maple Creek as H; z = s * x = (3) * (x) = 3*x; F = i * w = (2) * (12) = 24; t = f * n = (2) * (15) = 30; Y = z + F = 3*x + 24 = 3*x + 24; H = Y + t = 3*x + 24 + 30 = 3*x + 54. We know H = 60, so we have 3*x + 54 = 60 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 3*x + 54 = 60. Move all terms to one side: 3*x - 6 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 3*x = 6. Divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 18, "id": 22, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many adult crow does Pine Ridge have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Beverly Forest as p; so p = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Maple Creek as s; so s = p = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Pine Ridge as P; T = s = 4; so P = 4 * T = (4) * (4) = 16. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Cedar Valley as I; so I = P = 16. Define adult crow in Pine Ridge as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define average number of newborn children per adult crow in Pine Ridge as U; so U = s = 4. Define adult eagle in Pine Ridge as V; so V = I = 16. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as A; R = s = 4; so A = 3 + R = 3 + 4 = 7. Define adult blue jay in Pine Ridge as D; J = I = 16; so D = 4 + J = 4 + 16 = 20. Define total number of newborn animal children in Pine Ridge as r; f = x * U = (x) * (4) = 4*x; u = V * P = (16) * (16) = 256; M = D * A = (20) * (7) = 140; K = f + u = 4*x + 256 = 4*x + 256; r = K + M = 4*x + 256 + 140 = 4*x + 396. We know r = 404, so we have 4*x + 396 = 404 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 4*x + 396 = 404. Move all terms to one side: 4*x - 8 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 4*x = 8. Divide both sides by 4: x = 8 / 4. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 18, "id": 0, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "What is the average number of newborn children per adult fox in Oakridge Riverside?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult wolf in Oakridge Riverside as S; so S = 2. Define average number of newborn children per adult deer in Oakridge Riverside as W; H = S = 2; so W = 1 + H = 1 + 2 = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult fox in Oakridge Riverside as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define adult wolf in Oakridge Riverside as Q; so Q = W = 3. Define average number of newborn children per adult bear in Oakridge Riverside as A; d = W = 3; so A = 3 * d = (3) * (3) = 9. Define adult deer in Oakridge Riverside as R; so R = Q = 3. Define adult bear in Oakridge Riverside as a; so a = S = 2. Define adult fox in Oakridge Riverside as v; so v = a = 2. Define total number of newborn animal children in Oakridge Riverside as J; K = Q * S = (3) * (2) = 6; f = R * W = (3) * (3) = 9; O = v * x = (2) * (x) = 2*x; k = a * A = (2) * (9) = 18; r = K + f = 6 + 9 = 15; P = r + O = 15 + 2*x = 2*x + 15; J = P + k = 2*x + 15 + 18 = 2*x + 33. We know J = 37, so we have 2*x + 33 = 37 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 2*x + 33 = 37. Move all terms to one side: 2*x - 4 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 2*x = 4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 18, "id": 4, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many adult blue jay does Bundle Ranch have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of newborn children per adult owl in Bundle Ranch as N; so N = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult eagle in Bundle Ranch as I; so I = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Bundle Ranch as p; so p = I = 4. Define average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Bundle Ranch as n; so n = 1. Define adult parrot in Bundle Ranch as A; so A = N + p = 4 + 4 = 8. Define adult owl in Bundle Ranch as h; T = I = 4; so h = 2 * T = (2) * (4) = 8. Define adult eagle in Bundle Ranch as U; so U = n = 1. Define adult blue jay in Bundle Ranch as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of newborn animal children in Bundle Ranch as B; v = A * n = (8) * (1) = 8; H = x * p = (x) * (4) = 4*x; W = U * I = (1) * (4) = 4; E = h * N = (8) * (4) = 32; P = v + H = 8 + 4*x = 4*x + 8; l = P + W = 4*x + 8 + 4 = 4*x + 12; B = l + E = 4*x + 12 + 32 = 4*x + 44. We know B = 60, so we have 4*x + 44 = 60 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 4*x + 44 = 60. Move all terms to one side: 4*x - 16 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 4*x = 16. Divide both sides by 4: x = 16 / 4. Solution: x = 4.

Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Shoreline City as C; so C = G = 14. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Shoreline City as g; so g = C = 14. Define regional medical school in Shoreline City as V; so V = g - d = (14) - (2) = 12. Define regional medical school in Riverton City as O; f = V = 12; so O = 1 + f = 1 + 12 = 13. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Riverton City as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Riverton City as s; so s = O * x = (13) * (x) = 13*x. We know s = 39, so we have 13*x = 39 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 13*x = 39. Move all terms to one side: 13*x - 39 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 13*x = 39. Divide both sides by 13: x = 39 / 13. Solution: x = 3. Answer: 3.", "op": 18, "id": 17, "template": "teachers_in_school", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}

", "question": "How many regional medical school does Ruby Bay have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define culinarian school in Shoreline City as k; so k = 4. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Clearwater Bay as q; Y = k = 4; so q = 2 + Y = 2 + 4 = 6. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Shoreline City as i; so i = q + k = 6 + 4 = 10. Define average number of teachers per private middle school in Ruby Bay as m; Q = i = 10; so m = 2 * Q = (2) * (10) = 20. Define average number of teachers per culinarian school in Ruby Bay as Z; so Z = i = 10. Define culinarian school in Ruby Bay as f; so f = 1. Define average number of teachers per regional medical school in Ruby Bay as J; so J = f = 1. Define private middle school in Ruby Bay as w; so w = 3. Define regional medical school in Ruby Bay as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of teachers from all schools in Ruby Bay as D; r = x * J = (x) * (1) = x; C = f * Z = (1) * (10) = 10; W = w * m = (3) * (20) = 60; n = r + C = x + 10 = x + 10; D = n + W = x + 10 + 60 = x + 70. We know D = 71, so we have x + 70 = 71 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: x + 70 = 71. Move all terms to one side: x - 1 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 1*x = 1. Divide both sides by 1: x = 1 / 1. Solution: x = 1. Answer: 1.", "op": 18, "id": 7, "template": "teachers_in_school", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "16k", "d": 3}
