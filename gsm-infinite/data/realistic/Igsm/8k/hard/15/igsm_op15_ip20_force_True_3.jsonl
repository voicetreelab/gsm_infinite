", "question": "How many solemn period drama does R\u00eaves de Belleville have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define solemn period drama in Festival Lumi\u00e8re de Valmont as i; so i = 1. Define upbeat metropolis comedy in Festival Lumi\u00e8re de Valmont as t; so t = i = 1. Define total number of movies in Festival Lumi\u00e8re de Valmont as z; so z = i + t = 1 + 1 = 2. Define average number of nominations per solemn period drama in Festival Lumi\u00e8re de Valmont as a; H = z = 2; so a = 4 * H = (4) * (2) = 8. Define average number of nominations per solemn period drama in R\u00eaves de Belleville as u; so u = a = 8. Define average number of nominations per upbeat metropolis comedy in R\u00eaves de Belleville as E; so E = t = 1. Define upbeat metropolis comedy in R\u00eaves de Belleville as p; so p = t + i = 1 + 1 = 2. Define solemn period drama in R\u00eaves de Belleville as x; we don't know its value yet but will find it out later. Define total number of movie nominations in R\u00eaves de Belleville as d; g = x * u = (x) * (8) = 8*x; D = p * E = (2) * (1) = 2; d = g + D = 8*x + 2 = 8*x + 2. We know d = 18, so we have 8*x + 2 = 18 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 8*x + 2 = 18. Move all terms to one side: 8*x - 16 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 8*x = 16. Divide both sides by 8: x = 16 / 8. Solution: x = 2.
