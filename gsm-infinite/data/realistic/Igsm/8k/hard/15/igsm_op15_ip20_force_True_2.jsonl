", "question": "How many upbeat metropolis comedy does Northwood Movie Festival have?", "solution": "The question is difficult, so we use equations to solve it. Define average number of nominations per calm road movie in Golden Banana Movie Festival as d; so d = 3. Define average number of nominations per intense detective thriller in Northwood Movie Festival as b; G = d = 3; so b = 3 * G = (3) * (3) = 9.

We know D = 252, so we have 36*x + 108 = 252 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 36*x + 108 = 252. Move all terms to one side: 36*x - 144 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 36*x = 144. Divide both sides by 36: x = 144 / 36. Solution: x = 4.
