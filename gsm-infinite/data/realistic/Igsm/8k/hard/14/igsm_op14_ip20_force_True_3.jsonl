We know F = 48, so we have 24*x = 48 and we solve it through the following steps: Simplifying the equation: 24*x = 48. Move all terms to one side: 24*x - 48 = 0. Isolate the term with x: 24*x = 48. Divide both sides by 24: x = 48 / 24. Solution: x = 2. Answer: 2.", "op": 14, "id": 2, "template": "crazy_zootopia", "mode": "forwardreverse", "length": "8k", "d": 3}
